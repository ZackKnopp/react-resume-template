My thesis work involved creating computer vision algorithms for reducing waste in industrial potato peeling processes. Also during my degree, I received an NSERC award, I wrote three conference papers, acted as a teaching assistant for multiple courses, and built a two-wheeled, inverted pendulum robot from the ground up."
